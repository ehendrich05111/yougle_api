# Yougle

The modern era provides a variety of messaging services, and almost everyone uses more than one. You may use Slack for work, Discord for gaming, and basic text messages for communicating with your friends. With all these services, it is easy to forget when and with what app you sent a message, and while they all individually provide functionality to search for messages, no app exists that can search them all. 

Yougle aims to solve this problem by conveniently searching for message content across all the messaging apps you use, so when you canâ€™t find that important Slack message from your boss or that goofy text message from your friend, Yougle is the solution for you.
